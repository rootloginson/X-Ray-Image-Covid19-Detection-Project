model2.zip:
    Contains Final ModifiedResnet18 model state.dict{}
    torch.save()
    # to use it "Mod1" class should be called. It is output layers of the Resnet18 pretrained model.
    # file names could be confusing. I was experimenting for a homework. Small story is at the end of this .txt file.
    
model2itself.zip:
    Contains whole model.
    torch.save()

ModelHistory: Files created with function calls in colab notebook. "def historySave():" and "def historyLoad():"
    Contains .json files of trained models.
        
        json files (11epoch.json) has: 
                - training loss
                - training accuracy
                - validataion loss 
                - validation accuracy
             
        trainining loss/acc of each epoch
        validation loss/acc of every 3 epoch
        
        Validation condition was (if epoch%3). 
        Therefore there is also a validation results for epoch 0.
        
        
    Contains .json files of test and test2.
    
        json files (11epoch_test.json and 11epoch_test2) has:
                - Ground truth values of images
                - Predictions
                - Actual Predictions(True predictions)  # there could be a better name <o.o>
                - Wrong Predictions
                

Number of the epochs which is "11" could be confusing. And I believe it is. 
This was the project that I was trying to learn practice. I built on top of that. 
At the beginning there was a naming convention ambiguity.
